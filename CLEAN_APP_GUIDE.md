# 🎯 **Clean Expense Tracker App - Ready to Use!**

I've created a **completely clean, working expense tracker app** that you can use right away. Here's everything you need to know:

## 🚀 **How to Run the App**

### Option 1: Update your main.dart (Recommended)
Replace the contents of `lib/main.dart` with the contents from `lib/main_clean.dart`:

```bash
cp lib/main_clean.dart lib/main.dart
```

### Option 2: Create a new app entry point
Keep your existing main.dart and run the new app directly:

```bash
flutter run lib/main_clean.dart
```
