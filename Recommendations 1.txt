Perfect! I can see all your screens. Here are the key files you need to modify for your expense tracker conversion:

Priority Files to Transform:
1. Travel Requests Dashboard (Main Priority)
File: lib/screens/travel_requests_dashboard.dart Changes Needed:

Convert "Travel Requests" → "Expenses"
Replace trip data with expense records (amount, category, date)
Change tab navigation from "Requests/Calendar/Profile" → "Expenses/Analytics/Profile"
Update filter system for expense categories instead of travel status
2. New Travel Request Form
File: lib/screens/new_travel_request_form.dart Changes Needed:

Transform into "Add Expense" form
Replace trip fields with: amount, category, description, date, receipt upload
Remove travel-specific sections (justification, attendees, locations)
Keep validation but adapt for expense data
3. Travel Request Detail View
File: lib/screens/travel_request_detail_view.dart Changes Needed:

Convert to "Expense Detail" view
Show expense breakdown instead of trip details
Remove approval workflow (unless you want expense approval)
Display receipt images and category information
4. Data Models (Critical)
Files: Look for lib/models/ folder Changes Needed:

Convert TravelRequest model → Expense model
Update field names and types
Modify Supabase service calls
Secondary Files:
Manager Approval Dashboard → Skip or convert to "Budget Overview"
Travel Calendar → Convert to "Expense History" or spending timeline
Next Step: Access your code view and locate these files. Which one would you like to start with? I recommend beginning with the Travel Requests Dashboard since it's your main screen.
